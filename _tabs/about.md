I'm a Full-Stack LLM Engineer specializing in LLM infrastructure, reinforcement learning research, and training platforms. With expertise spanning the entire LLM lifecycle, I bridge the gap between cutting-edge AI research and production-ready systems.

## Expertise

My technical focus areas include:

- **LLM Infrastructure Engineering** - Architecting and optimizing large-scale training and inference systems
- **Reinforcement Learning Research** - Enhancing LLM reasoning and tool calling capabilities with Agent RL
- **Training Platform Development** - Building robust platforms for efficient model training and evaluation
- **Applied AI Research** - Transforming cutting-edge research into practical applications

## Let's Connect

I'm always interested in discussing research opportunities, professional collaborations, or just exchanging ideas about LLMs and reinforcement learning. Feel free to reach out via [GitHub](https://github.com/jybsuper) or [email](mailto:jybsuper@gmail.com).
